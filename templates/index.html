<h2>Overview&nbsp;</h1>
<p><span>We propose to model the data for an animal shelter&rsquo;s foster system. On average, approximately five </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Locations</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> within the system are responsible for 100 </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Animals</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;"> per month. Each facility employs a staff of about 12 </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Mentors </span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">who liaison between a facility and a number of </span><em><span style="font-weight: 400;">Volunteers</span></em><span style="font-weight: 400;">. Explained simply, an animal shelter within the system allows people to temporarily adopt animals. Staff members employed by a particular shelter train volunteers to care for the animals and supervise the adoption process. Once an animal is permanently adopted they are removed from the foster care system.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span">The animal shelters are currently on a paper system used to track volunteers, fosters, animal information, etc. and have had constant issues losing documents. These documents are key to finding a suitable volunteer that is experienced enough to adequately care for an animal offered in the foster system. This database will be used to keep track of all information in a consolidated location that can be easily viewed by users at the shelter to determine which volunteers are available and best-suited to foster specific animals.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span">The foster system currently has issues locating eligible individuals and animals available for the foster process. This system will also be used to make the foster process for the locations more efficient by allowing administrators to search for volunteers with certain criteria and effectively partner them with volunteers that can fit their needs. They can document this in the system noting which volunteers are currently fostering animals and which animals are currently unavailable for foster so volunteers that are unable to foster are not selected. Furthermore, they will also be able to use the system to track a volunteer&rsquo;s experience level, allowing them to see which volunteers need further training in order to be suitable fosters for the animals. This ensures that the animals have the best caretaker and given the support they need for the future furever homes.</span></p>
